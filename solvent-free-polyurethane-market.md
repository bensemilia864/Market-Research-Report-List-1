<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solvent-free Polyurethane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocomponent</li><li>Bi-component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solvent-free polyurethane market is primarily divided into two types: monocomponent and bi-component systems. Monocomponent polyurethane formulations are pre-reacted and ready for application, requiring no mixing, which simplifies usage and enhances stability. In contrast, bi-component systems consist of two separate components, typically an isocyanate and a polyol, that must be mixed before application. This allows for greater customization of properties but requires precise formulation and timing for optimal performance. Both types are increasingly popular due to their environmentally friendly profiles.</p></p>
